## Technical Implementation

### CSS Variable Strategy
Used CSS custom properties for easy theme switching:
```css
:root { /* Dark theme variables */ }
[data-theme="light"] { /* Light theme overrides */ }
```

### JavaScript Theme Application
Theme applied via `data-theme` attribute on body element:
- Dark mode: No attribute (default)
- Light mode: `data-theme="light"`

### LocalStorage Key
- Key: `'theme'`
- Values: `'dark'` or `'light'`

## Accessibility Features
- Proper ARIA label on toggle button
- Full keyboard navigation support (Enter and Space keys)
- Focus ring visible when navigating with keyboard
- Sufficient color contrast in both themes
- Clear visual feedback on hover and active states

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers supporting:
  - CSS custom properties
  - localStorage API
  - SVG
  - CSS transitions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test theme toggle in both desktop and mobile views
2. Verify theme persistence after page refresh
3. Test keyboard navigation (Tab to button, Enter/Space to toggle)
4. Verify all UI elements (messages, sidebar, buttons) work in both themes
5. Check code blocks and markdown rendering in light mode
6. Test hover and active states
7. Verify smooth transitions between themes
